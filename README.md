# xray-dl-project
 
This project concerns the use of neural networks to classify chest x-ray images
as normal or as having pneumonia. This project explores how well the models
developed for this project compare against state-of-the-art implementations. The
key element of this projectâ€™s implementation is the use of pretrained models. The
project also explores the ways of overcoming the challenges of small and unbalanced
data sets.
